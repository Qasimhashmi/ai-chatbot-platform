AI Chatbot Integration Platform
This platform automates the process of adding an AI chatbot to any website. Whether it's an e-commerce site, a social platform, or a SaaS business, the platform crawls the website, extracts relevant content, and integrates an AI chatbot to assist users in real-time. No technical knowledge is required, and everything is automated!

Features
Automated Website Crawling: The platform automatically crawls a website to extract content such as headings, paragraphs, and other valuable information.
AI Chatbot Integration: Once the content is extracted, the platform generates a unique URL that can be embedded into any website as a fully functional chatbot.
Works with Any Website: The platform supports various types of websites, including e-commerce, blogs, SaaS platforms, and social media sites.
No-Code Solution: Users can integrate a chatbot without writing a single line of code.
Tech Stack
Frontend: Next.js (React-based framework)
Backend: API routes in Next.js for server-side logic
AI Chatbot: Integration with popular AI chatbot services like OpenAI's GPT (or other chatbot APIs)
Web Scraping: Cheerio.js for efficient content extraction

Restrictions & Guidelines
To maintain the integrity and quality of the project, please follow these restrictions:

Sensitive Information:
Never commit sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, or tokens. Use environment variables to store sensitive data securely.

Website Crawling:

Respect robots.txt: Make sure not to crawl websites that disallow it.
If a website is too large or the content extraction fails, please open an issue to track and investigate it.
Content Ownership:
Ensure that content you extract from websites respects copyright laws. Avoid using or reproducing copyrighted content without proper permission.

Scalability Considerations:
As the platform grows, we’ll need to optimize the web scraping process to handle larger websites efficiently. If you notice performance bottlenecks, consider submitting optimizations.
